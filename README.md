# CIFAR10-Classifier
This is a basic CNN trained to identify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10).
Its accuracy score is 76%

The data itself can be downloaded directly from the [University of Toronto website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) or you can access it directly via sklearn (I had more trouble with this method, it's a bit opaque and I preferred to get this data the same way you'd access any image set).

This was the result of several iterations of much simpler approaches that just didn't score well at all, but this one works quite well considering its size is quite small!

If you want to learn how to do this, look for [Shadab Hussain](https://www.kaggle.com/shadabhussain) on Kaggle - his tutorial was a fantastic guide.
